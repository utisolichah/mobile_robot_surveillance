Preliminary Study on Movement Controls and Data Streaming in Mobile Robot Surveillance
Surveillance is a growing topic that can be applied in multiple fields, such as crowd and social monitoring, wildlife research, and agrarian monitoring. 
This research is inspired from previous applicable fields in creating a mobile robot to do the surveillance. 
This paper focuses on the control movement and data streaming system implemented in the robot. 
The robot will be able to be remotely piloted based on the commands of a user interfacing with a web-based platform. 
The robot will also be able to operate a camera to capture footage in real-time, encode it, and send it to be stored in a server. 
In the future, this image capture may be expanded to cover for data processing in object recognition. 
This paper also presents some designs that can be developed as the basis for future researches
